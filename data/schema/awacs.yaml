# Cooperative engagement mechanics
cooperative_engagement:
  detection_sharing:
    description: >
      AWACS shares detection data with all linked fighters and SAM sites,
      enabling network-centric warfare. Fighters can engage targets they
      have not detected themselves, using AWACS track data.
    latency_seconds: 2
    accuracy_degradation: 0.05  # 5% accuracy loss vs own-sensor data

  bvr_guidance:
    description: >
      AWACS provides mid-course guidance for BVR missiles, extending
      effective engagement range. Fighter radar need not illuminate target
      until terminal phase.
    range_extension: 0.30  # +30% effective BVR range
    requires_datalink: true
    max_simultaneous_guidances_per_awacs: 6

  target_handoff:
    description: >
      AWACS can hand off a tracked target from one fighter to another
      seamlessly, enabling relay attacks and coordinated multi-axis strikes.
    handoff_time_seconds: 5
    success_rate: 0.95

  silent_running:
    description: >
      Fighters can operate radar-silent while receiving AWACS track data,
      maintaining stealth until weapons release. AWACS acts as the sensor.
    fighter_rcs_reduction: 0.40  # 40% RCS reduction with radar off
    detection_range_provided_by_awacs: true
    engagement_limitation: "Fighter must activate own radar for terminal guidance"

# Limitations and vulnerabilities
limitations:
  ew_disruption:
    radar_jamming_vulnerability: 0.30  # 30% detection degradation under heavy EW
    datalink_jamming:
      effect: "Cooperative engagement degrades to basic detection sharing"
      threshold: "Requires dedicated standoff jammer within 200km"
    eccm_capability:
      phalcon: 0.80  # Good ECCM
      netra: 0.60
      erieye: 0.75
      zdk03: 0.65

  awacs_kill_effect:
    description: >
      Loss of an AWACS platform severely degrades a faction's air defense
      and offensive air capability. High-value target priority.
    detection_loss_percent: 40  # 40% detection capability lost per AWACS kill
    bvr_range_reduction: 0.30  # 30% BVR range reduction without AWACS
    morale_impact: 10  # Morale penalty to air units
    replacement_time_turns: 99  # Effectively irreplaceable in theater

  bandwidth_limits:
    description: >
      Each AWACS can only manage a finite number of cooperative engagements
      simultaneously. Exceeding capacity degrades service quality.
    max_fighters_managed:
      phalcon: 24
      netra: 12
      erieye: 16
      zdk03: 20
    overload_degradation: 0.10  # Per-fighter degradation when over capacity
