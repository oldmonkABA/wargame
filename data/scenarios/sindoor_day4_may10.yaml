  name: "Operation Sindoor — Day 4: The Blitz"
  description: |
    May 10, 2025. After 3 days of attrition, IAF launches decisive multi-axis
    strikes. BrahMos, SCALP-EG, and Rampage missiles target Nur Khan AB (C2 hub),
    Murid AB (drone operations center), Sargodha, Jacobabad, and Rafiqui.
    PAF depleted from 3 days of losses. Ceasefire trigger active — international
    pressure forces halt if either side loses 40% combat power.
