  description: |
    May 9, 2025. PAF launches its largest drone wave — 600 drones including
    Yihaa-III loitering munitions, decoys, TB2s, and Songar rotary-wing
    platforms. Primary targets: S-400 batteries and forward airbases.
    JF-17 Block 3 fires CM-400AKG anti-radiation missiles at S-400.
    Indian Akash and Akashteer integrated AD network faces its ultimate test.
